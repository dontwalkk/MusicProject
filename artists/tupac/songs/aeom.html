          [Intro: 2Pac]<br>
          Big Syke, 'Nook, Hank, Bogart, Big Sur (yeah)<br>
          Y'all know how this shit go (you know)<br>
          All eyes on me<br>
          Motherfuckin' OG<br>
          Roll up in the club and shit, is that right?<br>
          All eyes on me<br>
          All eyes on me<br>
          But you know what?<br>
          <br>
          [Verse 1: 2Pac]<br>
          I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust<br>
          So many player-hatin' niggas tryna sound like us<br>
          Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin'<br>
          Straight to the depths of Hell is where those cowards goin'<br>
          Well, are you still down? Nigga, holla when you see me<br>
          And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me<br>
          I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride<br>
          Hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by<br>
          Until I die, live the life of a boss player<br>
          'Cause even when I'm high, fuck with me and get crossed later<br>
          The futures in my eyes, 'cause all I want is cash and thangs<br>
          A five-double-0 Benz, flauntin' flashy rings, uhh<br>
          Bitches pursue me like a dream<br>
          Been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend<br>
          It seems, my main thing was to be major paid<br>
          The game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade<br>
          Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies<br>
          One nigga's gettin' jealous and motherfuckers died<br>
          Depend on me like the first and fifteenth<br>
          They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me<br>
          We got foe niggas and low riders in ski masks<br>
          Screamin', "Thug Life" every time they pass, all eyes on me<br>
          <br>

          [Chorus: 2Pac]<br>
          Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die<br>
          Live the life of a boss player (All eyes on me) 'cause even gettin' high<br>
          All eyes on me<br>
          Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die<br>
          Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high<br>
          <br>
          [Interlude: Big Syke]<br>
          Hey, to my nigga 'Pac<br>
          <br>
          [Verse 2: Big Syke]<br>
          So much trouble in the world, nigga<br>
          Can't nobody feel your pain<br>
          The world's changin' every day, time's movin' fast<br>
          My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?<br>
          I'm caught between my woman and my pistol and my chips<br>
          Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip<br>
          I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin' life flawless<br>
          Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this<br>
          Mediocres got a lot of nerve<br>
          Let my bucket swerve, I'm takin' off from the curb<br>
          The nervousness neglect make me pack a TEC<br>
          Devoted to servin' this Moët and pay checks<br>
          Like Akai satellite, nigga, I'm forever ballin'<br>
          It ain't right: parasites, triggers, and fleas crawlin'<br>
          Sucker, duck and get busted, no emotion<br>
          My devotion is handlin' my business, nigga, keep on coastin'<br>
          Where you goin', I been there, came back as lonely, homie<br>
          Steady flowin' against the grain, niggas still don't know me<br>
          It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit<br>
          It ain't funny, niggas don't even know how to act, shit<br>
          What can I do? What can I say? Is there another way?<br>
          Blunts and gin all day, 24 parlay<br>
          My little homie G, can't you see I'm buster-free?<br>
          Niggas can't stand me; all eyes on me<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          [Chorus: 2Pac]<br>
          Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die<br>
          Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high<br>
          All eyes on me<br>
          All eyes on me<br>
          Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die<br>
          Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high<br>
          All eyes on me<br>
          <br>
          [Verse 3: 2Pac]<br>
          The feds is watchin', niggas plottin' to get me<br>
          Will I survive? Will I die? Come on, let's picture the possibility<br>
          Givin' me charges, lawyers makin' a grip<br>
          I told the judge I was raised wrong and that's why I blaze shit<br>
          Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager<br>
          On my mobile, callin' big shots on the scene major<br>
          Packin' hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law<br>
          Bitches, I fuck with a passion, I'm livin' rough and raw<br>
          Catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane<br>
          Hustle 'til the mornin', never stopped until the cash came<br>
          Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die<br>
          Live my life as a boss player, 'cause even gettin' high<br>
          These niggas got me tossin' shit<br>
          I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit<br>
          Keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer<br>
          Up in the Benz, burnin' rubber<br>
          The money is mandatory, the hoes is for the stress<br>
          This criminal lifestyle, equipped with a bulletproof vest<br>
          Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket, get your money<br>
          Motherfucker, let's get rich and we'll kick it; all eyes on me<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          [Chorus: 2Pac]<br>
          Live the life as a thug nigga until the day I die<br>
          Live the life as a boss player 'cause even gettin' high<br>
          All eyes on me<br>
          All eyes on me<br>
          Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die<br>
          Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high<br>
          All eyes on me<br>
          <br>
          [Outro: 2Pac]<br>
          Pay attention, my niggas! See how that shit go?<br>
          Nigga walk up in this motherfucker and it be like, "Bing!"<br>
          Cops, bitches, every-motherfuckin'-body<br>
          (Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die)<br>
          (Live my life as a boss playa, 'cause even gettin' high)<br>
          I got bustas, hoes, and police watchin' a nigga, you know?<br>
          (I live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die)<br>
          (Livin' life as a boss playa, 'cause even gettin' high)<br>
          He he he, it's like what they think<br>
          I'm walkin' around with some ki's in my pocket or somethin'<br>
          They think I'm goin' back to jail, they really on that dope<br>
          (Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die)<br>
          (Live my life as a boss playa)<br>
          I know y'all watchin', I know y'all got me in the scopes<br>
          (Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die)<br>
          (Live my life as a boss playa, 'cause even gettin' high)<br>
          I know y'all know this is Thug Life, baby!<br>
          Y'all got me under surveillance, huh?<br>
          All eyes on me, but I'm knowin'<br>
