          [Intro: 2Pac]<br>
          Little something for my godson Elijah<br>
          And a little girl named Corin<br>
          <br>
          [Verse 1: 2Pac & Dave Hollister]<br>
          Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice<br>
          I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots (Oh)<br>
          I give a holla to my sisters on welfare<br>
          2Pac cares if don't nobody else care (Oh)<br>
          And, uh, I know they like to beat you down a lot<br>
          When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot<br>
          But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up<br>
          Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up<br>
          And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him<br>
          And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him<br>
          'Cause, sister, you don't need him<br>
          And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em (You don't need him)<br>
          You know what makes me unhappy? (What's that?)<br>
          When brothers make babies<br>
          And leave a young mother to be a pappy (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
          And since we all came from a woman<br>
          Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman (Yeah, yeah)<br>
          I wonder why we take from our women<br>
          Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?<br>
          (Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)<br>
          I think it's time to kill for our women<br>
          Time to heal our women, be real to our women<br>
          And if we don't, we'll have a race of babies<br>
          That will hate the ladies that make the babies (Oh, yeah-yeah)<br>
          And since a man can't make one<br>
          He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one<br>
          So will the real men get up?<br>
          I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up<br>

          [Chorus: Dave Hollister]<br>
          (Keep ya head up)<br>
          Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier<br>
          (Keep-keep ya head up)<br>
          Ooh, child, things'll get brighter<br>
          (Oh-oh, keep ya head up)<br>
          Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier<br>
          (Keep-keep ya head up)<br>
          Ooh, child, things'll get brighter<br>
          <br>
          [Verse 2: 2Pac & Dave Hollister]<br>
          Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me<br>
          He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be<br>
          And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough<br>
          And though we had it rough, we always had enough<br>
          I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules<br>
          Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two<br>
          I realize Mama really paid the price<br>
          She nearly gave her life to raise me right (Oh, yeah-yeah)<br>
          And all I had to give her was my pipe dream<br>
          Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen<br>
          I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents<br>
          It's hard to be legit and still pay your rent<br>
          And in the end, it seems I'm headin' for the pen'<br>
          I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind<br>
          Last night, my buddy lost his whole family<br>
          It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity (Oh, no, no, no)<br>
          It seems the rain'll never let up<br>
          I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up, huh<br>
          You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours<br>
          They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor<br>
          Said it ain't no hope for the youth<br>
          And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future<br>
          And then they wonder why we crazy, huh<br>
          I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby<br>
          We ain't meant to survive 'cause it's a set-up<br>
          And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up<br>
          [Chorus: Dave Hollister]<br>
          (Keep ya head up)<br>
          Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier<br>
          (Keep-keep ya head up)<br>
          Ooh, child, things'll get brighter<br>
          (Oh-oh, keep ya head up)<br>
          Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier<br>
          (Keep-keep ya head up)<br>
          Ooh, child, things'll get brighter<br>
          <br>
          [Verse 3: 2Pac & Dave Hollister]<br>
          And, uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own<br>
          I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone<br>
          Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome<br>
          Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em<br>
          'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure<br>
          And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more (Oh-oh)<br>
          'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son<br>
          Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'<br>
          You can't complain, you was dealt this hell of a hand<br>
          Without a man, feelin' helpless (I know you were)<br>
          Because there's too many things for you to deal with<br>
          Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless<br>
          While the tears is rollin' down your cheeks<br>
          You're steady hopin' things don't all fall this week (Yeah)<br>
          'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it (Yeah)<br>
          And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it (Oh, yeah)<br>
          And now my son's gettin' older and older<br>
          And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders<br>
          While the rich kids is drivin' Benz<br>
          I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends (Oh, yeah)<br>
          And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up<br>
          But, huh, please, you got to keep your head up<br>
