          I ain't got no mothafuckin' friends<br>
          That's why I fucked yo' bitch, you fat mothafucka!<br>
          (Take money) Westside, Bad Boy killas<br>
          (Take money) (You know) You know who the realest is<br>
          (Take money) Niggas, we bring it too<br>
          That's a'ight, haha<br>
          (Take money) Haha<br>
          <br>
          [Verse 1: 2Pac]<br>
          First off, fuck yo' bitch and the clique you claim<br>
          Westside when we ride, come equipped with game<br>
          You claim to be a player, but I fucked your wife<br>
          We bust on Bad Boys, niggas fucked for life<br>
          Plus, Puffy tryna see me, weak hearts I rip<br>
          Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A., some mark-ass bitches<br>
          We keep on comin' while we runnin' for your jewels<br>
          Steady gunnin', keep on bustin' at them fools, you know the rules<br>
          Lil' Caesar, go ask your homie how I'll leave ya<br>
          Cut your young-ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased<br>
          Lil' Kim, don't fuck around with real G's<br>
          Quick to snatch yo' ugly ass off the streets, so fuck peace!<br>
          I'll let them niggas know it's on for life<br>
          Don't let the Westside ride tonight (Hahaha)<br>
          Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed<br>
          Fuck with me and get yo' caps peeled, you know<br>
          See, grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac<br>
          Call the cops when you see 2Pac, uh<br>
          Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish<br>
          Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace<br>
          Nigga, I hit 'em up! (Yeah)<br>
          <br>
          [Interlude: 2Pac]<br>
          Check this out (Take money)<br>
          You motherfuckers know what time it is<br>
          I don't even know why I'm on this track (Take money)<br>
          Y'all niggas ain't even on my level<br>
          I'ma let my lil' homies ride on you bitch-made ass (Take money)<br>
          Bad Ay ay ayo hold the fuck up<br>
          Boy bitches, feel it! (Take money)<br>
          <br>
          [Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]<br>
          Get out the way yo, get out the way yo<br>
          Biggie Smalls just got dropped<br>
          Little Mu', pass the MAC and let me hit him in his back<br>
          Frank White needs to get spanked right for settin' traps<br>
          Little accident murderer, and I ain't never heard of ya<br>
          Poisonous gats attack when I'm servin' ya<br>
          Spank ya, shank ya whole style when I gank<br>
          Guard your rank 'cause I'ma slam your ass in the paint<br>
          Puffy weaker than the fuckin' block I'm runnin' through, nigga<br>
          And I'm smokin' Junior M.A.F.I.A. in front of you, nigga<br>
          With the ready power tucked in my Guess under my Eddie Bauer<br>
          Your clout petty/sour, I push packages every hour; I hit 'em up!<br>
          <br>
          [Chorus: 2Pac]<br>
          Grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac<br>
          Call the cops when you see 2Pac, uh<br>
          Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish<br>
          Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace<br>
          Nigga, we hit 'em up!<br>
          <br>
          [Verse 3: 2Pac]<br>
          Peep how we do it, keep it real as penitentiary steel<br>
          This ain't no freestyle battle<br>
          All you niggas gettin' killed with your mouths open<br>
          Tryna come up off of me, you in the clouds hopin'<br>
          Smokin' dope, it's like a sherm high<br>
          Niggas think they learned to fly<br>
          But they burn, mothafucka, you deserve to die<br>
          Talkin' about you gettin' money, but it's funny to me<br>
          All you niggas livin' bummy while you fuckin' with me<br>
          I'm a self-made millionaire<br>
          Thug livin', out of prison, pistols in the air (Haha)<br>
          Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch<br>
          And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?<br>
          Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style<br>
          Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it and smiled<br>
          Now I'm back to set the record straight<br>
          With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate<br>
          Mothafucka, I hit 'em up!<br>
          <br>
          [Verse 4: Kadafi]<br>
          I'm from N-E-W Jers' where plenty of murders occurs<br>
          No points or commas, we bring the drama to all you herbs<br>
          Now go check the scenario: Little Cease<br>
          I'll bring you fake G's to your knees, coppin' pleas in de Janeiro<br>
          Little Kim, is you coked up or doped up?<br>
          Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up<br>
          What the fuck, is you stupid?<br>
          I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn<br>
          With my click lootin', shootin' and pollutin' your block<br>
          With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot<br>
          Outlaw MAFIA clique movin' up another notch<br>
          And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped<br>
          All your fake-ass East Coast props brainstormed and locked<br>
          <br>
          [Verse 5: E.D.I. Mean]<br>
          You's a beat biter, a Pac style taker<br>
          I'll tell you to your face, you ain't shit but a faker<br>
          Softer than Aliz√© with a chaser<br>
          'Bout to get murdered for the paper<br>
          E.D.I. Mean approach the scene of the caper<br>
          Like a loc, with Little Ceas' in a choke<br>
          Gun totin' smoke, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke<br>
          Thug Life, niggas better be knowin'<br>
          We approachin' in the wide open, gun smokin'<br>
          No need for hopin', it's a battle lost<br>
          I got 'em crossed as soon as the funk is boppin' off<br>
          Nigga, I hit 'em up!<br>
          <br>
          [Outro: 2Pac]<br>
          Now you tell me who won<br>
          I see them, they run, hahahaha<br>
          They don't wanna see us (Take money)<br>
          Whole Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique dressin' up tryna be us (Take money)<br>
          How the fuck they gonna be the mob<br>
          When we always on our job? (Take money)<br>
          We millionaires<br>
          Killin' ain't fair, but somebody gotta do it (Take money)<br>
          Oh yeah, Mobb Deep, huh, you wanna fuck with us? (Take money)<br>
          You little young-ass mothafuckas (Take money)<br>
          Don't one of you niggas got sickle-cell or somethin'? (Take money)<br>
          You're fuckin' with me, nigga<br>
          You fuck around and have a seizure or a heart attack (Take money)<br>
          You better back the fuck up<br>
          Before you get smacked the fuck up<br>
          This is how we do it on our side<br>
          Any of you niggas from New York that wanna bring it, bring it!<br>
          But we ain't singin', we bringin' drama<br>
          Fuck you and yo' motherfuckin' mama!<br>
          We gon' kill all you motherfuckers!<br>
          Now, when I came out, I told you it was just about Biggie<br>
          Then everybody had to open their mouth with a motherfuckin' opinion<br>
          Well, this is how we gonna do this: Fuck Mobb Deep! Fuck Biggie!<br>
          Fuck Bad Boy as a staff, record label, and as a motherfuckin' crew!<br>
          And if you wanna be down with Bad Boy, then fuck you too!<br>
          Chino XL, fuck you too!<br>
          All you motherfuckers, fuck you too!<br>
