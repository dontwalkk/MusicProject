      <div class="lyrics">
        <p>
          [Intro: Frankie Cosmos]<br>
          Boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window<br>
          Boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window<br>
          <br>
          [Verse 1: TV Girl]<br>
          My girl Liddy used to always smoke<br>
          Cigarettes when she couldn't sleep<br>
          She'd disappear for an hour and a half<br>
          And when she'd come back, she'd brush her teeth<br>
          But I could still smell it on her raggedy tee<br>
          And I could taste it on her lips when we kissed<br>
          Poor little Liddy used to always quit<br>
          But she never really quit<br>
          She'd just say she did<br>
          <br>
          [Chorus: Frankie Cosmos]<br>
          Boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window (Ooh-ooh)<br>
          Boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window (Ooh-ooh)<br>
          Boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window (Ooh-ooh)<br>
          Boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window (Ooh-ooh)<br>
          <br>
          [Verse 2: TV Girl]<br>
          My girl Liddy used to always smoke<br>
          Cigarettes when she couldn't sleep<br>
          I wonder what she did when she got done<br>
          I guess she'd just flick them out in the street<br>
          Poor little Liddy, she wishes it was dark<br>
          But it's never really dark in LA<br>
          The light from the billboard always shines<br>
          But it changed twelve times since you went away<br>
          <br>
          [Chorus: Frankie Cosmos]<br>
          Boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window (Ooh-ooh)<br>
          Boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window (Ooh-ooh)<br>
          Boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window (Ooh-ooh)<br>
          Boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window (Ooh-ooh)<br>
          <br>
          [Outro: Victor Jory]<br>
          You'll find moonlit nights strangely empty because when you call my name through them there'll be no
          answer<br>
          Rather melodramatic, aren't you?<br>
          You'll find moonlit nights strangely empty because when you call my name through them there'll be no
          answer<br>
          You mind if I smoke?<br>
          You'll find moonlit nights strangely empty because when you call my name through them there'll be no
          answer<br>
          (Ooh-ooh)<br>
          I always smoke with the theatre<br>
          You'll find moonlit nights strangely empty because when you call my name through them there'll be no
          answer<br>
          (Ooh-ooh)<br>
          Somehow it enhances the performance<br>
