        <p>
          [Verse 1: Brad Petering]<br>
          Are you sick of me?<br>
          Would you like to be?<br>
          I'm tryin' to tell you somethin'<br>
          Somethin' that I already said<br>
          You like a pretty boy<br>
          With a pretty voice<br>
          Who is tryin' to sell you somethin'<br>
          Somethin' that you already have<br>
          <br>
          [Chorus: Brad Petering, Brad Petering & Faith Harding]<br>
          But if you're too drunk to drive, and the music is right<br>
          She might let you stay, but just for the night<br>
          And if she grabs for your hand, and drags you along<br>
          She might want a kiss before the end of the song<br>
          Because love can burn like a cigarette<br>
          And leave you with nothin'<br>
          And leave you with nothin'<br>
          <br>
          [Verse 2: Brad Petering]<br>
          While the others talked<br>
          We were listenin' to Lover's Rock<br>
          In her bedroom<br>
          In her bedroom<br>
          And if you start to kiss<br>
          And the record skips<br>
          Flip it over<br>
          And sit a little closer<br>
          You might also like<br>
          Not Allowed<br>
          TV Girl<br>
          Cigarettes out the Window<br>
          TV Girl<br>
          All Of The Girls You Loved Before<br>
          Taylor Swift<br>
          [Chorus: Brad Petering, Brad Petering & Faith Harding]<br>
          But if you're too drunk to drive, and the music is right<br>
          She might let you stay, but just for the night<br>
          And if she grabs for your hand, and drags you along<br>
          She might want a kiss before the end of the song<br>
          Because love can burn like a cigarette<br>
          And leave you with nothin'<br>
          And leave you with nothin'<br>
          <br>
          [Dialogue: Lafitte & Constance]<br>
          Now, how many men have you kissed?<br>
          Very few. <br>
          But you offered me a kiss. Why?<br>
          Such a foolish reason, I'm afraid. I just wanted to kiss you. <br>
          <br>
          [Bridge: Brad Petering]<br>
          Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du<br>
          Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du<br>
          Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du<br>
          Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du<br>
          <br>
          [Outro: Brad Petering, Faith Harding, Brad Petering & Faith Harding]<br>
          Because love can burn like a cigarette (Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du)<br>
          (Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du)<br>
          And leave you with nothin' (Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du)<br>
          And leave you with nothin' (Du)<br>
