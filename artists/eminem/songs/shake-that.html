        <p>Woo! Shady, Aftermath
          Look at that bitch
          Oh, shit, hey (Damn)
          <br>
          [Chorus 1: Eminem & Nate Dogg]<br>
          There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'<br>
          Bumpin' and grindin' that pole<br>
          The way she's grindin' that pole<br>
          I think I'm losin' control<br>
          <br>
          [Verse 1: Eminem]<br>
          Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk<br>
          Get fucked up, hit the strip club<br>
          Don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed, get fucked<br>
          Get sucked, get wasted, shit-faceted<br>
          Pasted, plastered â€“ puke, drink, throw up<br>
          Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up<br>
          Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'<br>
          Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'<br>
          I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated<br>
          I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated<br>
          Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it<br>
          I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit<br>
          <br>
          [Verse 2: Nate Dogg]<br>
          Two to the one, from the one to the three<br>
          I like good pussy and I like good tree<br>
          Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe<br>
          And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat<br>
          Three to the one, from the one to the three<br>
          I met a bad bitch last night in the D<br>
          Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:<br>
          Conversation and Hennessy<br>
          I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop<br>
          Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop<br>
          If I ain't got a weapon, I'ma pick up a rock<br>
          And when I bust yo' ass, I'm gon' continue to rock<br>
          Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet<br>
          It's real easy, just follow the beat<br>
          Don't let that fine girl pass you by<br>
          Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie<br>
