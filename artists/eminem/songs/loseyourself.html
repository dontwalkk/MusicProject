          [Intro]<br>
          Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity<br>
          To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment<br>
          Would you capture it or just let it slip?<br>
          Yo<br>
          <br>
          [Verse 1]<br>
          His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy<br>
          There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti<br>
          He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready<br>
          To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting<br>
          What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud<br>
          He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out<br>
          He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now<br>
          The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow<br>
          Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity<br>
          Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad<br>
          But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it<br>
          He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter<br>
          He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant<br>
          He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's<br>
          Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody<br>
          Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him<br>
          <br>
          [Chorus]<br>
          You better lose yourself in the music<br>
          The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)<br>
          You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
          This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
          You better lose yourself in the music<br>
          The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)<br>
          You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
          This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
          You better<br>
          <br>

          [Verse 2]<br>
          His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping<br>
          This world is mine for the taking, make me king<br>
          As we move toward a new world order<br>
          A normal life is boring, but superstardom's<br>
          Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder<br>
          Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over<br>
          These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows<br>
          He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads<br>
          God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father<br>
          He goes home and barely knows his own daughter<br>
          But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water<br>
          These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product<br>
          They moved on to the next schmoe who flows<br>
          He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera<br>
          Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner<br>
          But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah<br>
          <br>
          [Chorus]<br>
          You better lose yourself in the music<br>
          The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)<br>
          You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
          This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
          You better lose yourself in the music<br>
          The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)<br>
          You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
          This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
          You better<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          [Verse 3]<br>
          No more games, I'ma change what you call rage<br>
          Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged<br>
          I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed<br>
          I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage<br>
          But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher<br>
          Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper<br>
          All the pain inside amplified by the<br>
          Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-<br>
          Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family<br>
          'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers<br>
          And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life<br>
          And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder<br>
          Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter<br>
          Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna<br>
          Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna<br>
          Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me<br>
          To the point I'm like a snail, I've got<br>
          To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot<br>
          Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not<br>
          Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got<br>
          To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot<br>
          So here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not<br>
          This may be the only opportunity that I got<br>
          <br>
          [Chorus]<br>
          You better lose yourself in the music<br>
          The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)<br>
          You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
          This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
          You better lose yourself in the music<br>
          The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)<br>
          You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
          This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
          You better<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          [Outro]<br>
          You can do anything you set your mind to, man<br>
